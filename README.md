**After the torch installation and the build finish, we can start trial on this**

run download_pack.sh to download networks from AWS S3


Code for CVPR15 paper "Learning to Compare Image Patches via Convolutional Neural Networks"
-----
This package allows researches to apply the described networks to match image patches and extract corresponding patches.

We tried to make the code as easy to use as possible. The original models were trained with Torch ( http://torch.ch ) and we release them in Torch7 and binary formats with C++ bindings which do not require Torch installation. Thus we provide example code how to use the models in Torch, MATLAB and with OpenCV http://opencv.org

### Models

We provide the models in Torch7 and binary format. The table from the paper is here for convenience.

**All models expect input patches to be in [0;1] range before mean subtraction.**

**The models are not supposed to give outputs in [0;1] range, the outputs are not normalized**

| Train set | Test set | 2ch | 2ch2stream | 2chdeep | siam | siam2stream |
| --- |  --- | :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |
| yosemite | notredame | 2.74 | **2.11** | 2.43 | 5.62 | 5.23 |
| yosemite | liberty | 8.59 | **7.2** | 7.4 | 13.48 | 11.34 |
| notredame | yosemite | 6.04 | **4.09** | 4.38 | 13.23 | 10.44 |
| notredame | liberty | 6.04 | 4.85 | **4.56** | 8.77 | 6.45 |
| liberty | yosemite | 7 | **5** | 6.18 | 14.76 | 9.39 |
| liberty | notredame | 2.76 | **1.9** | 2.77 | 4.04 | 2.82 |


Models in nn format can be loaded and used without CUDA support in Torch. To enable CUDA support ```model:cuda()``` call required.

An archive with all models (binary and in torch format) is available at: <https://s3.amazonaws.com/modelzoo-networks/cvpr2015matching_networks.tar.gz>

### Torch

To install torch follow http://torch.ch/
Check torch folder for examples.
Match patches on CPU:

```lua
require 'nn'

N = 76  -- the number of patches to match
patches = torch.rand(N,2,64,64):float()

-- load the network
net = torch.load'../networks/2ch/2ch_liberty.t7'

-- in place mean subtraction
local p = patches:view(N,2,64*64)
p:add(-p:mean(3):expandAs(p))

-- get the output similarities
output = net:forward(patches)
```

Conversion to a faster `cudnn` backend is done by `cudnn.convert(net, cudnn)` function.

### C++ API

The code was tested to work in Linux (Ubuntu 14.04) and OS X 10.10, although we release all the source code to enable usage in other operating systems.

We release CUDA code for now, CPU code might be added in the future. To install it you need to have CUDA with the up-to-date CUDA driver (those are separate packages).

Install TH and THC:

```
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/torch/torch7.git
cd torch7/lib/TH
mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..; make -j4 install
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/torch/cutorch.git;
cd cutorch/lib/THC
mkdir build; cd build
cmake ..; make -j4 install
```

Clone and compile this repository it with:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/szagoruyko/cvpr15deepmatch
cd cvpr15deepmatch
mkdir build; cd build;
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install
make -j4 install
```

Then you will have ```loadNetwork``` function defined in src/loader.h, which expects the state and the path to a network in binary format on input. A simple example:

```c++
THCState *state = (THCState*)malloc(sizeof(THCState));
THCudaInit(state);

cunn::Sequential::Ptr net = loadNetwork(state, "networks/siam/siam_notredame.bin");

THCudaTensor *input = THCudaTensor_newWithSize4d(state, 128, 2, 64, 64);
THCudaTensor *output = net->forward(input); // output is 128x1 similarity score tensor
```

Only 2D and 4D tensors accepted on input.

Again, **all binary models expect input patches to be in [0;1] range before mean subtraction.**

After you build everything and download the networks run test with ```run_test.sh```. It will download a small test_data.bin file.

### MATLAB

Building Matlab bindings requires a little bit of user intervention. Open matlab/make.m file in Matlab and put your paths to Matlab and include/lib paths of TH and THC, then run ```>> make```. Mex file will be created.

To initialize the interface do

```
deepcompare('init', 'networks/2ch/2ch_notredame.bin');
```
To reset do

```
deepcompare('reset')
```

To propagate through the network:

```
deepcompare('forward', A)
```
```A``` can be 2D, 3D or 4D array, which is converted inside to 2D or 4D array (Matlab is col-major and Torch is row-major so the array is transposed):

| #dim | matlab dim | torch dim |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 2d | N x B | B x N |
| 3d | 64 x 64 x N | 1 x N x 64 x 64 |
| 4d | 64 x 64 x N x B | B x N x 64 x 64 |

2D or 4D tensor is returned. In case of full network propagation for example the output will be 2D: 1 x B, if input was B x 2 x 64 x 64.

To set the number of GPU to be used (the numbering starts from 1):

```
deepcompare('set_device', 2)
```
Print the network structure:

```
deepcompare('print')
```

To enable splitting the computations of descriptor and decision parts in siamese networks we saved their binary parts.

* siamese network:

| Train Set | siam_desc | siam_decision |
| --- | :---: |  :---: |
| yosemite | 3.47 MB,siam_desc_yosemite.bin | 1.00 MB,siam_decision_yosemite.bin |
| notredame | 3.47 MB,siam_desc_notredame.bin | 1.0MB,siam_decision_notredame.bin |
| liberty | 3.47 MB,siam_desc_liberty.bin | 1.00 MB,siam_decision_liberty.bin |

* siam-2stream network:

| Train Set | siam2stream_desc | siam2stream_decision |
| --- |  :---: |  :---: |
| yosemite | 9.16 MB,siam2stream_desc_yosemite.bin | 4.01 MB,siam2stream_decision_yosemite.bin |
| notredame | 9.16 MB,siam2stream_desc_notredame.bin | 4.01 MB,siam2stream_decision_notredame.bin |
| liberty | 9.16 MB,siam2stream_desc_liberty.bin | 4.01 MB,siam2stream_decision_liberty.bin |


### OpenCV

OpenCV example is here to demonstrate how to use the deep CNN models to match image patches, how to preprocess the patches and use the proposed API.

Depends on OpenCV 3.0. To build the example do

```
cd build;
cmake -DWITH_OPENCV=ON -DOpenCV_DIR=/opt/opencv .; make -j8
```
Here ```/opt/opencv``` has to be a folder where OpenCV is built. If you have it installed, you don't need to add it, ```-DWITH_OPENCV=ON``` will be enough.

To run the example download the images:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openMVG/ImageDataset_SceauxCastle/master/images/100_7100.JPG
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openMVG/ImageDataset_SceauxCastle/master/images/100_7101.JPG
```

and run it:

```
./build/opencv/example networks/siam2stream/siam2stream_desc_notredame.bin 100_7100.JPG 100_7101.JPG
```

You have to use descriptor matching network in this example. Check the example code for explanation.


### CAFFE

Thanks to the awesome @ajtulloch's [torch2caffe](https://github.com/facebook/fb-caffe-exts) models were converted to CAFFE format. Unfortunatelly only _siam_, _2ch_ and _2chdeep_ models could be converted at the time, other models will be converted as missing functionality is added to CAFFE.
